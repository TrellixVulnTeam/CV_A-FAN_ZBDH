## Overview

**Q1:** *Can adversarial training, as data augmentation, broadly boost the performance of various visual recognition tasks on clean data, not only image classification, but also object detection, semantic segmentation or so?*

**Q2:** *If the above answer is yes, can we have more efficient and effective options for adversarial data augmentation, e.g., avoiding the high cost of finding input-level adversarial perturbations?*
